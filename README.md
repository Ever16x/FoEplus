## Installation (5 minutes)

1. Download and extract [FoEplus](https://github.com/Ever16x/FoEplus/archive/master.zip)
2. Install [Capture2Text](https://sourceforge.net/projects/capture2text/) - either place it in the existing empty folder, or change "ocrExe" in *settings.txt*
3. Run *FoEplus.exe*, right-click systray icon\
If blocked by Windows Defender - either click More info -> Run anyway, or proceed with the following steps

Optional - if running source script is preferred over pre-compiled binary:

4. Install [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/)
5. Run (double-click) *FoEplus.ahk* from step #1, right-click systray icon

Notes:

**Capture2Text** - Without Capture2Text which provides OCR, FoEplus will still function but with reduced capacity.

**Extract first** - Make sure to extract everything first. Running it directly from the zip file won't work.

**Anti-virus** - AutoHotkey programs and components are known to sometimes trigger false positives from low grade\
anti-virus software. Rest assured FoEplus is open source and safe.

## Caveats

**Future Development** - As of Dec. 29, 2019, the program does its job well. However there won't be any future development.\
If anyone would like to develop the project further, please do not hesitate to contact Ever16x@gmail.com.
